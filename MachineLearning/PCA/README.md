### PCA: Principal Component Analysis

#### Dimenslonality Reduction Techniques
Why?
+ Makeing the dataset easier to use
+ Reducing computational cost of many algorithms
+ Removing noise
+ Making the results easier to understand

How?
+ Principal Component Analysis: 
+ Factor Analysis
+ Independent Component Analysis(ICA)

#### Principal Component Analysis
+ Pros: Reduces complexity of data, indentifies most important features
+ Cons: May not be needed, could throw away useful imformation
+ Works with: Numerical values
