### Typical Interview Process
+ **2 - 3 Telephonic interviews: **The purpose of telephonic interviews is to screen you before flying you over for onsite interviews. Typically, the interviews focus on easy algorithmic questions where you are asked to writecode on a shared code editor like collabedit. The interview also tries to evaluate whether there are red signals to your cultural fit into the company.

    - **Interview 1 - 2 (Coding): **At least a couple of interviews focus on your algorithmic skills (nothing too advanced) and your coding accuracy.
    - **Interview 3 (Coding or System design): **This interview depends on your years of experience, and the position you are considered for. Senior engineers (typically more than 2 years of experience) are tested on their understanding of systems operating on huge scale and architectural design.
